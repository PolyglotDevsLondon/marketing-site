        <h3>Students</h3>
        <p>Our students are a mixture of backgrounds and skills, some are just starting to code and 
          some are already engineers working on expanding their skillset.<br /><br /> No previous coding experience 
          is nessesary but it will mean that initially you will spend time working on tutorials and 
          playing with different tech before starting on your first ticket towards our two projects:<br /><br />
          <strong>Polyglot Devs website</strong><br /><br />> React / Gatsby / JavaScript / CSS / HTML / Netlify
          <br />> Simple website to share our initiaive with the world (ps. it is this website!)<br /><br />

          <h3>Mentors</h3>
          <p>We are always on a lookout for more mentors. Some mentors are even students at certain sessions 
          especially as some events may be a little quiet for a mentor if students are busy giving a go alone.
          <br /><br />If you are thinking of becoming a mentor but are not sure, please apply to mentor if: <br /><br />> You are 
          an experienced coder in any of the following: Python / Django / JavaScript / React / Sass / HTML 
          <br /><br />> You enjoy helping others and collaborating <br /><br />> You are patient and donâ€™t mind going 
          over the same concept multiple times if needed <br /><br />That is all! The rest can be picked up as 
          we go along. If this sounds appealing please join us.</p>
